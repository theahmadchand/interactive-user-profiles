# Interactive User Profiles

This project is an interactive front-end application built with React and TypeScript, designed to display user profiles fetched from a RESTful API. The application features a listing component with pagination, filters based on gender, search functionality, and individual public profile pages for each user. The components are structured to be reusable, well-documented, and optimized for performance to minimize unnecessary re-renders. Tailwind CSS is used for styling to ensure a modern and responsive user interface.
